This is the explanation of the tasks performed by each member and the group
and percentages reflecting group effort.

There were two members to Group 5:
-Matt McDermott U70910297
-Sam Suddath <ID# HERE>

Building the class:
Together we collaborated on designing the class called DirectedGraph.  Each
part of this class was decided upon, designed, and realized in code by us.  The 
constructors, destructor and operator overloading functions were created by Sam 
Suddath. The functions to access private members were created by Matt McDermott.  
The original idea to use vectors as our base data structure to the adjacency 
list was thought of by Sam Suddath, but we both developed the functions that 
create and display the adjacency list.
The following group percentages apply:
-Matt McDermott -> 50%
-Sam Suddath -> 50%

Creating the search functions:
When designing and implementing the search functions, we decided to create 
functions for breadth-first search and depth-first search.  Although we 
consulted each other for help, we wrote the actual code independently of each
other.  The following shows who designed and wrote which functions:
-Matt McDermott -> Depth-First Search
-Sam Suddath -> Breadth-First Search
